# Parameter-Calculator-of-Transistor
This app is supposed to calculate and store the saturation mobility, threshold voltage, on/off ratio and sub threshold swing of field effect transistor
You can input the test parameters to get device's performance parameters
And you can check these data in cells, if the mobility of your device is surpass 5, the number will turn red
If you are doubted about the correction, you can check it with the calculator embeded in APP
